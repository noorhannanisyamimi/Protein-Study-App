# Protein Study App

## Introduction
The Protein Study App is a web-based application designed for researchers, educators, and students interested in protein data analysis. Built with Streamlit, the app offers a user-friendly interface to retrieve and analyze protein sequences, visualize protein-protein interaction networks, and compare protein sequences. It utilizes data from the UniProt database and STRING database to provide comprehensive insights into protein characteristics and interactions.

## Features
- **Protein Data Retrieval**: Fetch detailed protein information using UniProt IDs.
- **Protein Sequence Analysis**: Analyze protein sequences to calculate molecular weight, amino acid composition, aromaticity, instability index, isoelectric point, and secondary structure fractions.
- **Protein-Protein Interaction Network**: Visualize interaction networks using data from the STRING database.
- **Protein Sequence Comparison**: Compare two protein sequences to evaluate their similarity.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Biopython
- Pandas
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
